## Setup Notes  
To run the backend correctly, make sure to complete the following steps:

#### 1. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder  
This file must contain your MongoDB connection string.
Use this format as an example:
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:27017/bookstore
```
Replace `YOUR_LOCAL_IP` with your own local address or database URL.

#### 2. Install backend dependencies  
Inside the `backend` folder, run:
```
npm install
```
This will install all required Node modules before running the server.
